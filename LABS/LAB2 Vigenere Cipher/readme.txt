Vigenere Cipher
Vigenere Cipher: Encryption, Decryption and Crypto-analysis

Objective:

Get familiarized with classical cryptography, specifically vigenere cipher.
Explore crypto-analysis based on “cipher-text only” attacks
Preamble: Mr. Mogambo got expelled from the military facility after the previous attack, where in he employed mono-alphabetic ciphers. Agent X felt that Mr. Mogambo’s computer may still have some important military documents and managed to copy a few into a USB drive by tricking him (the usual Bond way). Help Agent X decrypt the first document. You tried crypto-analysis based on mono-alphabetic cipher, but that did not yield any proper results. Mr. Mogambo sure seems to have learnt a lesson! But how smart can he be! You conjecture that he must have used a poly-alphabetic cipher like vigenere cipher. You decided to dig into this cipher more to understand it better and in the process decrypt the document.
